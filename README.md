# react-dragtastic
A simple drag and drop library for React which uses the more stable mouseDown/mouseUp pattern instead of the problematic HTML5 drag and drop API

## Installation

```shell
npm install --save react-drag-and-drop
or
yarn add react-drag-and-drop
```

## Usage

###### For ES6 and up
```javascript
import { Draggable, Droppable } from 'react-dragtastic';
```

###### For ES5
```javascript
var dnd = require("react-dragtastic");

var Droppable = dnd.Droppable;
```
